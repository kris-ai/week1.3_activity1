# Question 1
## Who are you? What is your background?

My name is Kris Kish. While I had a short love affair with Comp. Sci / Engineering in college, my true passion lay in creative work. I am an Impact Creative Director with a background in advertising, psychology, and design.

# Question 2
## What are your career goals?

My career goals and my overall vision in life are highly intertwined - I am going to impact 1 billion people on this planet with my creativity and art. It's very apparent to me that this will require financial resources, so I aim to generate large amounts of it to support global change through creative campaigns. 

# Question 3
## Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?

To create an impact on this planet requires financial resources. This is something I have learned through experience. Ultimately, I aim to leave an impace on this planet through my creativity, funded through my impact investing and financial skills learned through this course and I know the future is FinTech. I chose FinTech because my old passion for coding has been revived and I want to implement that skill in creative ways to generate abundance.
